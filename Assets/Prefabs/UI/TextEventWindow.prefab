  m_text: "Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura is a 2001 role-playing video
    game developed by Troika Games and published by Sierra On-Line for Microsoft
    Windows. The game's story takes place within a fantasy setting currently undergoing
    a transformation from its own Industrial Revolution, in which magic competes
    against technological gadgets, and focuses on the efforts of a zeppelin crash
    survivor to find out who attacked the vessel, ultimately discovering a plot by
    an ancient power to return to the world and cause chaos. The game, conducted
    from an isometric perspective and within an open world, offers players the opportunity
    to craft their protagonist with a variety of skills, including the option to
    be gifted in magic or use guns and gadgets to combat enemies, and complete quests
    in different ways.\n\n\nThe game proved a commercial success for Troika following
    its release, selling over 200,000 copies and generating revenue of over US$8.8
    million, being deemed the fourth best-seller for video games within the period
    of its launch by NPD Intelect.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nGameplay in Arcanum consists
    of traveling through the game world, visiting locations and interacting with
    the local inhabitants, typically in real-time. Occasionally, inhabitants will
    require the player's assistance in various tasks, which the player may choose
    to solve in order to acquire special items, experience points, or new followers.
    Many quests offer multiple solutions for the player, depending on their playing
    style, which may consist of combat, persuasion, thievery, or bribery. Ultimately,
    players will encounter hostile opponents (if such encounters are not avoided
    using stealth or diplomacy), in which case they and the player will engage in
    combat, which can be real-time or turn-based.\n\n\nCombat\n\nThree combat modes
    were included in the final release of the game: real-time, turn-based, and a
    faster version of turn-based. Arcanum's combat design has received some levels
    of criticism, with reviews usually stating that it is poorly balanced and frantic.
    The player's combat capabilities are in large part governed by the character's
    combat skills and weapons. Attacking is performed automatically by clicking on
    a hostile NPC provided that they are in range of the attack.\n\n\nCombat skills
    that the player character can choose from include melee weapons (with an optional
    back stabbing skill for stealth-oriented players), thrown weapons, archery, firearms,
    and a large variety of certain damage-inflicting spells from some schools of
    magic. Deciding whether or not to use violence in some parts of the game sometimes
    carries consequences for the player's party and its followers. Some AI-controlled
    followers the player has in the party will find their character's conduct morally
    objectionable, causing the player to lose reputation with some of the followers
    who may leave or even attack the player.\n\n\nCharacter creation\n\nArcanum begins
    with the player creating their character, choosing from a large and unique variety
    of races, attributes, technological skills, magical aptitudes, and background
    traits, or the player may choose a predefined character. Over the course of the
    game, the character may improve their skills by gaining experience through completing
    quests or defeating opponents in combat. Every time the player gains a level,
    they can spend one character point to improve any attribute, weapon skill, technological
    discipline, school of magic, thievery skill, or social skill. Every fifth level,
    one additional character point is awarded for a total of 64 character points.
    The player can only control one character directly but may recruit additional
    followers during the game depending on their aptitudes and alignment.\n\n\nPlayer
    characters have the choice of specializing in a technological path which emphasizes
    constructing weapons, ammunition, and items from various components; a magical
    path which emphasizes spellcasting; or a neutral path, learning both magic and
    technology skills, which allows the most flexibility. The game uses a meter to
    show how biased towards magic or technology the player is; any character points
    spent on a technological discipline or skill move the aptitude meter towards
    the technology side and any points spent on spells move it towards the magical
    side. Character points spent on attributes or any other skills do not alter the
    aptitude meter. A high aptitude toward technology renders the character resistant
    or immune to magic (both harmful and beneficial) and also greatly decreases the
    character's ability to use magic effectively and limits the effectiveness of
    magical items. A high magical aptitude increases the effects of the character's
    magic and the power of magical items they equip, but technological items they
    equip will be subject to malfunctions, reflected in an increasingly higher chance
    of the character critically failing in combat, which can have devastating effects.\n\n\nModules\n\nThe
    game, like its successors in the Neverwinter Nights series, features \"modules\";
    the ability to create custom maps and missions using an editor included with
    the game. Already included with the game is Vormantown, and a number of official
    modules are also available.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nSetting\n\nArcanum is the name of
    the fantasy world in which the game unfolds. It consists of a continental mainland
    and three islands. The world is inhabited by various races resembling those from
    the works of Tolkien, including humans, elves and half-elves, dwarves, gnomes,
    halflings, orcs, ogres, and various wildlife. Players can choose from humans,
    elves, dwarves, gnomes, halflings, and human hybrid races, including half-elves,
    half-orcs and half-ogres as playable races.\nThe continent is divided between
    several different political entities. The Unified Kingdom is rapidly industrializing. 
    Its two largest cities are Tarant and Ashbury, and it is the most technologically
    advanced kingdom. The Kingdom of Cumbria is a deteriorated kingdom, consisting
    of Dernholm and Black Root, and ruled by an old conservative king. The Kingdom
    of Arland, extending from Caladon to Roseborough, is a small but thriving monarchy
    west of the Stonewall range. The Glimmering Forest, the largest in Arcanum, is
    home to the elven city of Qintarra and the dark elven city of T'sen-Ang, and
    has been untouched by the technological advancements of the time. The Stonewall
    and Grey Mountain Ranges are home to the remaining dwarven clans: the Black Mountain
    Clan, the Stonecutter Clan, the Wheel Clan, and the Iron Clan. Many other minor
    settlements also exist, as well as containing ruins of past civilizations.  The
    biggest of these is the ruins of Vendigroth, the most advanced city on Arcanum,
    which met a sudden and mysterious end.\n\n\nAn important in-game dynamic is the
    dichotomy of magic and technology in the world. Technology is explained to function
    by using physical law to produce a desired result, e.g., a bolt of electricity
    from a Tesla Gun would arc through the most conductive path to its target, with
    some plated armors being more prone to electrical damage than others. Magic,
    on the other hand, is explained to manipulate physical law to make a lightning
    spell follow the shortest path to the target, instead of the natural path. The
    two are incompatible to the point that they overwhelm each other.  Technological
    devices will become ineffective or even permanently inoperative in the presence
    of powerful magic and vice versa. Much of the population has chosen to embrace
    technology for its efficiency, accessibility, and permanent results, while the
    majority of elves, dark elves, and some humans and half-elves continue to practice
    magic exclusively. This also affects interactions between different characters,
    as spells cast on technologists or firearms used against mages have a failure
    rate.\n\n\nOrcs and ogres are looked down upon as savage, feral peoples by Arcanum's
    civilized folk, who own virtually all the industry of the major population centers.
    There is a great enmity between elves and dwarfs, the former being naturally
    inclined towards magically defined society, the latter being forerunners of the
    technology race\u2014and many elves blame the dwarfs for the rise of human technology
    and concomitant waning of elfish political power. Scientists are unwelcome in
    magical societies like Qintarra or Tulla but will be respected if they are righteous
    and good folk. Conversely, a mage would be admitted onto a steam train only on
    the provision that he take a third-class seat on the last caboose, so as not
    to cause interference with the engine (despite there being no in-game mechanic
    by which even the powerful mages can affect it). Powerful mages may be denied
    transport altogether.\n\n\nPlot\n\nArcanum begins with a cut scene of the IFS
    Zephyr, a luxury zeppelin, on her maiden voyage from Caladon to Tarant. Two monoplanes,
    piloted by Half-Ogre bandits, close in on the craft and commence attack runs,
    succeeding in shooting it down. An old gnome who is a passenger aboard the Zephyr
    is now in his death throes under charred debris and tells the player to bring
    a silver ring to \"the boy,\" and promptly dies. Being the only survivor of the
    crash, the main character is proclaimed as \"The Living One,\" a holy reincarnate,
    by the only witness to the crash, Virgil. The story follows the player's path
    as he or she searches for the origin of the ring. Over the course of the game,
    the player uncovers more about the history of the continent, the motivation of
    the assassins who are trying to kill him or her, and the identity of the one
    threatening to end all life in the land.\n\n\nArcanum is an example of a non-linear
    role-playing game. At various points throughout the game, players may take the
    story in different directions, sometimes permanently removing different paths
    of action. The game's central quest ultimately develops according to how players
    navigate its dichotomies, the most apparent being that of magic and technology.
    Many of the game's side quests allow for more than one solution depending on
    the player character's specializations and certain portions of the main quest
    can be solved more easily through dialogue than through combat. The game's magic/technology
    and good/evil alignments also influence what followers a character can attract
    throughout the game or how other NPCs will react to the player.\n\n\nThe game
    is also notable for being possible to complete in everything from a completely
    pacifist to a completely violent way. The player can, technically, kill every
    person they meet and still complete the game, even the very first companion they
    meet at the start of the game - if the person was an important NPC with plot
    information to divulge, they will carry that information with them in the form
    of a journal or the like. Likewise, the player is technically able to avoid combat
    altogether from start to finish, and can defeat even the final boss of the game
    without using violence (although this requires certain conditions to be fulfilled
    to be possible to do). Most players will of course fall somewhere between these
    two extremes, but the possibility is unusual for a role-playing game and also
    something that remains popular with fans.\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nArcanum's public
    beta testing commenced in September 2000. It is the debut title of now-defunct
    development house Troika Games, which consisted of former Interplay Entertainment
    staff\u2014most notably Tim Cain\u2014responsible for 1997's critically acclaimed
    Fallout. On release, the game was found to be incompatible with some video cards,
    such as Voodoo2, and drivers such as nVidia's Detonator3. Furthermore, the game's
    copy protection software, SecuROM, caused system-component conflicts with particular
    brands of sound cards and CD-ROM drives. Such bugs, as well as some gameplay
    bugs, were one of the game's biggest criticisms.\n\n\nThe latest official patch,
    1.0.7.4 was released in October 2001. With the end of the official support several
    unofficial patches were produced by the game community to fix the many remaining
    problems and bugs.\n\n\nDesign\n\nArcanum's large, free-form world bears many
    similarities to Fallout with regards to the scarcity of towns, cities, or other
    locations of interest; however Arcanum's map is much larger and more diverse
    than Fallout's. The travel system has some similarities with The Elder Scrolls
    in that the world can be traveled across in-game (where occasionally the player
    runs into enemy groups), without the use of the world map, and that the game
    doesn't rush the player into pursuing the main quest.\n\n\nThe game comes packaged
    with an editor, called WorldEdit, that allows players to create their own maps,
    campaigns, and NPCs. The program allows any game-world object to be input into
    existing and newly created environments via GUI menus. Editing can be done in
    either isometric or top-down views. Players have charge over the game's variables,
    such as the skill level required to pick a certain lock or the precise time that
    an electric light will turn on. Players are also able to create brand new objects
    via the scenery creator.\n\n\nSequel\n\nIn a 2000 interview with Nextgame.it,
    Tim Cain announced plans for an Arcanum sequel, but these plans would not come
    to pass\u2014Troika Games filed for dissolution on September 30, 2005.\n\n\nIn
    September 2006, one of Arcanum's lead programmers and co-founder of Troika, Leonard
    Boyarsky, divulged that the studio had originally commenced work on a sequel,
    going by the working title of Journey to the Centre of Arcanum, which would use
    Valve's Source Engine. Development was curtailed by disputes between Sierra and
    Valve, resulting ultimately in the project being shelved.\n\n\nIn 2023, Cain
    told that the game took inspiration from Jules Verne's Journey to the Center
    of the Earth and it would have taken place underground. In the story, the player
    character would be hired by the wife of Franklin Payne to find her husband. Payne
    had gone on an underground expedition in a search for an ancient civilization
    after building a drilling machine. During the game, the player would find a special
    ore that allows to create items where magic and technology could be combined
    without conflict.\n\n\nSoundtrack\n\nComposed by Ben Houge, Arcanum's soundtrack
    features an unusual instrumentation by avoiding the predominantly symphonic orchestration
    common to RPG soundtracks. Instead, it is scored almost entirely for string quartet.
    The songs follow the conventional RPG soundtrack format: short, impressionistic
    vignettes which are looped in-game, with each area using different tunes, and
    alternative songs for combat. The soundtrack was produced by Ben Houge and Jeff
    Pobst, with Leonid Keylin on first violin, Kathy Stern on second violin, Vincent
    Comer on viola, Susan Williams on cello, Evan Buehler on marimba, and Ben Houge
    on djembe, rainstick and synthesiser. The game's soundtrack has been well received,
    and was listed amongst the 12 best video-game soundtracks of all time by Forbes
    in 2012. The soundtrack was not commercially released but is available for free
    download.\n\n\nReception\n\nSales\n\nWriting for GameSpot, Desslock reported
    that Arcanum \"sold very well\" in the United States during its initial weeks,
    but \"faded\" from the charts afterward. The game entered NPD Intelect's computer
    game sales rankings at #4 for the week ending August 25. It fluctuated between
    positions four and five for another two weeks, before exiting the weekly charts
    in the September 9\u201315 period. Arcanum was the United States' 11th-best-selling
    computer game for the month of September, and totaled domestic sales of 69,522
    units by the first week of November. According to Chart-Track, Arcanum was also
    September's 10th-highest computer game seller in the United Kingdom. Remarking
    upon its chart position, Anthony Holden of PC Zone wrote that it was \"good to
    see that a relatively minor RPG with solid gameplay values can shift a few units\".\n\n\nArcanum
    ultimately sold 234,000 copies and drew revenues of $8.8 million by February
    2005. It was Troika Games' most commercially successful release by that date.
    The website GameDaily characterized its commercial performance as substandard,
    and as a contributing factor to the studio's closure in 2005.\n\n\nCritical reviews\n\nCarla
    Hacker reviewed the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five,
    and stated that \"An in-depth and engaging role-playing game that deviates from
    the traditional fantasy setting.\"\n\n\nArcanum received \"generally favorable\"
    reviews from critics, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\n\nThe
    game received two Editor's Choice Awards from IGN and GameZone with scores of
    8.7 out of 10 and 90 out of 100, respectively. IGN stated that \"the story is
    rich and complex\", praising the character creation, open-ended gameplay, and
    size of the game world. They also praised the game for its responsiveness to
    the player: \"A well-adjusted Elf may get more information out of an aristocrat
    than a surly Half-Ogre, and the conversations you have will be completely different.\"
    IGN did, however, criticize its interface, calling it \" very intuitive, bordering
    on downright clunky\" and the in-game user interface \"takes up over a third
    of the screen\". Gamezone called it a RPG with \"some extra bite\", also praising
    the character creation and gameplay, stating, \"This one will be on your PC for
    months\". Additionally, they praised the \"incredible range of equipment that
    ranges from standard such as swords and armor to rags and coal and empty cans\".\n\n\nThe
    game also received praise from The Electric Playground, which awarded the game
    9 out of 10 and calling it \"the most diverse and open-ended RPG to date.\" Game
    Revolution praised the game, particularly the character creation, stating, \"Whomever
    you are, the world treats you accordingly\", but also criticized the graphics.
    Game Informer rated the game as 6.75 out of 10, GamePro gave it 4 out of 5 and
    Mygamer awarded the game 8 out of 10.\n\n\nGameSpot gave the game a rating of
    7.3 out of 10, calling it a \"captivating and immersive role-playing experience\"
    and praising the setting as a \"great concept\". Their review, however, was adverse
    on the claim of lackluster graphics, and unintuitive interface as the main criticisms:
    \"There's nothing flattering about the dated, washed-out, low-resolution graphics\".\n\n\nThe
    editors of Computer Games Magazine named Arcanum the best role-playing game of
    2001\u2014tied with Wizardry 8\u2014and presented it with their \"Best Writing\"
    award. They called Arcanum a \"phenomenally well-written\" title with an \"incredibly
    creative\" setting. It also won PC Gamer US's, RPG Vault's, The Electric Playground's
    and IGN's 2001 \"Role-Playing Game of the Year\" prizes, and was nominated in
    GameSpy's \"PC RPG Game of the Year\" and GameSpot's \"Best Single-Player Role-Playing
    Game\" and \"Best Story\" categories. PC Gamer's editors wrote, \"Arcanum greatly
    exceeded our expectations, optimizing everything we hold dear about roleplaying
    on the computer.\"\n\n\n"
